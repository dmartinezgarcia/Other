These is programming that doesn't fit in any other repository. A brief explanation of each folder:

**Left Truncatable Prime Generator**: Program in C that generates the Left Truncatable Prime in the position specified by the user. It implements a deterministic form of the Miller Rabin algorithm to test the primality of numbers, also circular buffers to store LTP tails into memory and quite a lot of modular arithmetic to avoid overflows. Currently it supports LTPs till 1.000.000.000 and it executes quite fast. This program was made as an exercise for an (succesful) interview process. Interesting exercise.
